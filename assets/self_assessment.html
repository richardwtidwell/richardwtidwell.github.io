  <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
  <p><strong>Introduction.</strong> Across three years at SNHU I moved from an enthusiastic hobbyist to a disciplined engineer who can design, ship, and defend production-ready web software. Travlr Getaways—a full-stack artifact enhanced throughout CS 499—captures that growth through deliberate architecture, measurable algorithmic gains, and a hardened database workflow.</p>
  <p><strong>Personal &amp; Professional Journey.</strong> I enrolled at SNHU as part of a deliberate reset when my first son was born. I left food service for technical support at an ISP, transitioned into network operations, and finally into an IT help desk role where a supportive manager encouraged me to automate internal workflows. Side projects such as a company-wide data consolidation pipeline and classical machine learning models (still running in production) gave me the chance to apply coursework the very next day at work. That momentum led to promotions into AI automation and, today, a lead engineer role on a B2B SaaS platform that still contains components I built while in this program.</p>
  <p><strong>Program Outcome Highlights.</strong> Collaboration &amp; communication: delivered a narrated code-review walkthrough, maintained contributor docs, and curated this portfolio for varied audiences. Professional communication: produced milestone narratives, OpenAPI references, and evidence blocks that explain trade-offs and provide reproducible steps. Algorithms &amp; data structures: implemented an O(1) LRU cache and prefix trie, benchmarked them, and added node:test coverage. Software engineering &amp; value delivery: migrated the Express API to TypeScript with layered services, structured logging, validation, and CI-friendly scripts. Security mindset: hardened write endpoints with JWT protection, deterministic capacity checks, and strict validation with documented 401/409 responses.</p>
  <p><strong>Artifact Highlights.</strong> Software engineering—layered, strongly typed Express/Angular stack with modern tooling. Algorithms &amp; data structures—in-memory caching and trie search pipeline with unit tests and benchmarks. Databases—embedded reservation schema, atomic booking logic, and occupancy analytics exposed via REST.</p>
  <p><strong>Career Goals &amp; Next Steps.</strong> Lead backend/full-stack initiatives that blend reliable data services with pragmatic automation—continuing the trajectory that started when I built internal tools at work. Deepen observability in Travlr (metrics, logs, dashboards) to sharpen operational instincts and SRE collaboration, and earn the AWS Developer certification while paying mentorship forward to upcoming engineers.</p>
  <p><strong>Reflection.</strong> CS 499 forced me to think like both architect and storyteller. Balancing caching, validation, and schema design while communicating the trade-offs reminded me that code delivers value only when others can trust and extend it. I am ready to join a professional team, advocate for quality, and keep learning on day one.</p>
