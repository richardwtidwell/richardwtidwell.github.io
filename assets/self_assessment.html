  <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
  <p>## Professional Self-Assessment (Draft)</p>
  <p>### Introduction</p>
  <p>Over the past three years at SNHU I have grown from an eager hobbyist into a disciplined engineer who can design, ship, and defend production-ready web software. My CS 499 capstone synthesizes that journey through a full-stack artifact (Travlr Getaways) that now showcases deliberate architecture, measurable algorithmic gains, and a database workflow hardened for real-world use. This self-assessment highlights the competencies that feel most market-ready and calls out areas where I intend to keep stretching.</p>
  <p>### Personal & Professional Journey</p>
  <p>I enrolled at SNHU as part of a deliberate reset when my first son was born. Recognizing that I wasn’t yet prepared for the future I wanted, I switched industries, returned to school, and overhauled my health and lifestyle. I moved from food service into an ISP’s support center, advanced through network operations, and eventually into an IT help desk role where a supportive manager encouraged me to automate internal workflows. Those side projects—including a data consolidation initiative that gave leadership a holistic operational view—were my first opportunities to apply classroom concepts at work the very next day. I even shipped classical machine learning models that are still running in production.</p>
  <p>That momentum led to a promotion into AI automation, and today I serve as a lead engineer on a B2B SaaS product that still relies on components I wrote while enrolled at SNHU. There was a magical stretch where coursework and day job reinforced each other in real time. The experience cemented my belief that continuous learning and mentorship have a compounding effect, and it has set the trajectory I want for my career in tech.</p>
  <p>### Growth Across the Program Outcomes</p>
  <p>1. **Collaboration & Communication**</p>
  <p>- Recorded and narrated a structured code review (“Milestone One”) that mirrors professional PR walkthroughs—complete with checklists, action items, and references to standards.</p>
  <p>- Maintained working notes, README updates, and GitHub Pages documentation targeted at peers, instructors, and future employers.</p>
  <p>- TODO: Add reflections about any group projects or internship experience that further honed collaboration.</p>
  <p>2. **Professional Communication Artifacts**</p>
  <p>- Authored milestone narratives and OpenAPI specs that explain *why* I made particular trade-offs (e.g., rate limiting, caching TTLs, schema validation).</p>
  <p>- Crafted a GitHub Pages portfolio with evidence blocks, instructions, and direct links to supporting assets.</p>
  <p>- TODO: Mention presentation decks, posters, or conference talks if applicable.</p>
  <p>3. **Algorithmic & Data-Structure Mastery**</p>
  <p>- Built an O(1) LRU cache and a prefix trie to accelerate search/auto-suggest workloads; benchmarked them with reproducible scripts and unit tests.</p>
  <p>- Evaluated asymptotic trade-offs (cache capacity vs. TTL) and documented the results alongside code.</p>
  <p>- TODO: Add examples from other courses (e.g., CS 260, CS 340) if you want to show breadth beyond the capstone.</p>
  <p>4. **Software Engineering & Value Delivery**</p>
  <p>- Migrated the Express API to TypeScript with layered services, structured logging (Pino), Zod validation, and automated test suites.</p>
  <p>- Introduced CI-friendly scripts (`npm run build`, `npm test`) and evidence-driven docs so contributors know how to run, seed, and verify the project.</p>
  <p>- TODO: Reference any DevOps, CI/CD, or mobile projects that reinforce this competency.</p>
  <p>5. **Security Mindset**</p>
  <p>- Hardened booking endpoints with JWT-protected analytics, request validation, and conflict detection that prevents overselling capacity.</p>
  <p>- Captured manual curl sessions and screenshots to prove expected 401/409 behaviors and healthy flows.</p>
  <p>- TODO: Consider adding a paragraph about secure coding coursework (CS 405) or threat modeling exercises.</p>
  <p>### Artifact Highlights</p>
  <p>- **Software Engineering Enhancement:** Layered, strongly typed Express/Angular stack with a modern toolchain and documented workflows.</p>
  <p>- **Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement:** In-memory caching + trie search pipeline with unit tests and benchmarks.</p>
  <p>- **Database Enhancement:** Embedded reservation schema, atomic booking logic, and occupancy analytics exposed via REST.</p>
  <p>### Career Goals & Next Steps</p>
  <p>- Aim to contribute as a backend or full-stack engineer focusing on data-rich services where performance, correctness, and DX all matter.</p>
  <p>- Immediate priorities:</p>
  <p>1. TODO: Insert target companies/roles, e.g., “secure a backend internship or junior SWE position in travel/e-commerce SaaS within six months.”</p>
  <p>2. Continue instrumenting the Travlr stack (metrics, logs, dashboards) to strengthen SRE/DevOps exposure.</p>
  <p>3. Study for cloud certifications (AWS Developer Associate?) to formalize deployment knowledge.</p>
  <p>### Reflection</p>
  <p>CS 499 forced me to think like both architect and storyteller. The technical work pushed me to reconcile trade-offs across caching, validation, and schema design, while the documentation reminded me that code is only as valuable as its ability to be trusted and understood. I now feel prepared to enter a professional team, advocate for quality, and keep learning on day one.</p>
  <p>> **TODO for final pass:**</p>
  <p>> - Personalize the introduction with your voice and career aspirations.</p>
  <p>> - Expand on collaboration anecdotes (team projects, work experience).</p>
  <p>> - Substitute concrete metrics (benchmark numbers, response times) where helpful.</p>
  <p>> - Add any honors, scholarships, or extracurriculars that show leadership or initiative.</p>
