  <h3>Milestone Two Narrative – Software Engineering & Design</h3>

  <p>CS 499 Module 2 Journal: Code Review</p>
  <p>Code review is a structured peer examination of a change set that checks design, correctness, readability, security, and maintainability before integration. It is important because it spreads knowledge across the team, finds defects earlier than testing alone, and enforces shared engineering standards, which lowers rework and operational risk (Google, n.d.; SmartBear, n.d.; OWASP Foundation, n.d.; Winters, Manshreck, & Wright, 2020). Key best practices include keeping reviews small and focused, writing clear change descriptions, using checklists, and time boxing sessions to protect reviewer attention. Empirical guidance supports reviewing about 200–400 lines of code per session at a measured pace and within roughly 60 minutes (SmartBear, n.d.). Reviews should occur as a pre-merge gate on each pull request so architectural issues, contract changes, and security risks are caught when they are cheapest to fix. Security reviews should explicitly verify input validation, authentication and authorization, error handling, logging, and dependency hygiene (Google, n.d.; OWASP Foundation, n.d.).</p>
  <p>I will record the review with QuickTime on macOS or OBS Studio on Windows, capturing screen and microphone for a concise walkthrough. My outline mirrors the rubric’s three categories and a visible checklist. Software Engineering and Design: state intent and scope, scan the diff, assess separation of concerns (controllers, services, repositories), typing and validation, error handling, logging, test presence, and documentation, then record concrete action items and owners. Algorithms and Data Structures: restate the problem and constraints, verify Big-O claims against code paths, examine choices such as an LRU cache for repeated queries and a prefix trie for type-ahead, check boundary conditions and test coverage, and confirm benchmark evidence. Databases: review schema and migrations, confirm indexes match query patterns, validate transactional correctness for workflows like booking and availability, verify data validation rules and least-privilege access, and note performance findings and follow ups. I will keep pull requests small, narration tight, the checklist visible, and close with decisions, risks, and next steps (Google, n.d.; SmartBear, n.d.; OWASP Foundation, n.d.).</p>
