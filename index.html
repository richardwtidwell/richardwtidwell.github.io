            <p><em>CS 499 Module Two Journal – Code Review Plan</em></p>
            <p>Code review is a structured peer examination of a change set that checks design, correctness, readability, security, and maintainability before integration. It spreads knowledge across the team, finds defects earlier than testing alone, and enforces shared engineering standards, lowering rework and operational risk (Google, n.d.; SmartBear, n.d.; OWASP Foundation, n.d.; Winters, Manshreck, &amp; Wright, 2020).</p>
            <p>My recorded review keeps PRs small, follows a visible checklist, and addresses three lenses:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Software engineering &amp; design:</strong> Validate separation of concerns, typing, validation, error handling, logging, tests, and documentation.</li>
              <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; data structures:</strong> Reconfirm problem statements, Big-O claims, boundary conditions, and benchmark evidence.</li>
              <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Inspect schemas, indexes, validation rules, and least-privilege access while logging follow-up actions.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>
        <p>Search acceleration via an LRU cache, prefix trie, server-side pagination, and indexed MongoDB queries to keep latency predictable.</p>
        <details class="accordion">
          <summary>Read Milestone Three narrative</summary>
          <div class="accordion__body">
            <p>The enhanced artifact is the Travlr search and listing subsystem. It exposes Mongo-backed endpoints consumed by the admin UI. For this milestone I focused on measurable latency improvements at the API layer, introducing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A capacity-bound LRU cache with TTL and instrumentation to reuse identical queries.</li>
              <li>A case-insensitive prefix trie powering typeahead for trip codes and names.</li>
              <li>Server-side pagination and compound sorting so work scales with page size rather than collection size.</li>
              <li>Repository/service abstractions with stable cache keys, periodic trie refresh, input validation, consistent error envelopes, and rate limiting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tests cover the LRU and trie using <code>node:test</code>, while benchmark scripts capture trie build times and cache throughput. The work addresses Outcome 3 by selecting structures with known complexity, Outcome 4 through layered design plus tests/benchmarks, and Outcome 5 via validation, bounded caches, and abuse-resistant limits.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned to favour designs with predictable cost and to pair indexing with in-memory assistance only when the working set can stay hot. Stable ordering, staleness, and worst-case query sweeps were mitigated with lexical traversal limits, periodic refresh, strict validation, and rate limiting.</p>

            <p>The database enhancement focuses on extending the Travlr API to support reservations end to end. Key additions include embedded reservation documents (customer name/email, party size, notes, timestamps), capacity-aware booking logic, and JWT-protected reporting endpoints.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Enhancements:</strong> Reservation services (`reservationService.bookTrip` / `getOccupancyReport`), Zod validation, structured errors, and synced Angular service models.</li>
              <li><strong>Evidence &amp; testing:</strong> Curl sessions capture successful bookings and occupancy summaries, while `src/test/bookingValidation.test.ts` exercises the new validator.</li>
              <li><strong>Outcomes covered:</strong> Outcome 3 (aggregation pipelines and deterministic capacity checks), Outcome 4 (layered design, tests, docs), Outcome 5 (JWT protection, strict validation, idempotent capacity checks).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Aligning schema design with real-world invariants (remaining seats, audit history) while keeping controllers thin reinforced the need for clear seams between services and data. Future work could include cancellation flows, reporting UI, and regression tests against dockerised MongoDB.</p>

      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>This capstone challenged me to merge classroom theory with production work. Expand the section below for the full reflection and remaining TODOs before final submission.</p>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Over the past three years at SNHU I have grown from an eager hobbyist into a disciplined engineer who can design, ship, and defend production-ready web software. My CS 499 capstone synthesizes that journey through a full-stack artifact (Travlr Getaways) that now showcases deliberate architecture, measurable algorithmic gains, and a database workflow hardened for real-world use.</p>

          <h3>Personal &amp; Professional Journey</h3>
          <p>I enrolled at SNHU as part of a deliberate reset when my first son was born. Recognizing that I wasn’t yet prepared for the future I wanted, I switched industries, returned to school, and overhauled my health and lifestyle. I moved from food service into an ISP’s support center, advanced through network operations, and eventually into an IT help desk role where a supportive manager encouraged me to automate internal workflows. Those side projects—including a data consolidation initiative that gave leadership a holistic operational view—were my first opportunities to apply classroom concepts at work the very next day. I even shipped classical machine learning models that are still running in production.</p>
          <p>That momentum led to a promotion into AI automation, and today I serve as a lead engineer on a B2B SaaS product that still relies on components I wrote while enrolled at SNHU. There was a magical stretch where coursework and day job reinforced each other in real time. The experience cemented my belief that continuous learning and mentorship have a compounding effect, and it has set the trajectory I want for my career in tech.</p>

          <h3>Growth Across the Program Outcomes</h3>

                <li><em>TODO:</em> Reference any DevOps, CI/CD, or mobile projects that reinforce this competency.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Security Mindset.</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Hardened booking endpoints with JWT-protected analytics, Zod validation, and deterministic capacity checks.</li>
                <li>Captured curl sessions showing expected 401/409 responses and successful flows.</li>
                <li><em>TODO:</em> Fold in insights from secure coding coursework (CS 405) or threat modeling exercises.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Artifact Highlights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Layered, strongly typed Express/Angular stack with a modern toolchain.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures:</strong> In-memory caching and trie search pipeline with unit tests and benchmarks.</li>
            <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Embedded reservation schema, atomic booking logic, and occupancy analytics exposed via REST.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Career Goals &amp; Next Steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Aim to contribute as a backend or full-stack engineer focused on data-rich services where performance, correctness, and DX all matter.</li>
            <li>Short-term priorities:
              <ul>
                <li><em>TODO:</em> Specify target roles/companies (e.g., “secure a backend internship or junior SWE role within six months”).</li>
                <li>Continue instrumenting the Travlr stack (metrics, logs, dashboards) to strengthen SRE/DevOps exposure.</li>
                <li>Pursue a cloud certification (AWS Developer Associate?) to formalize deployment knowledge.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>CS 499 forced me to think like both architect and storyteller. The technical work pushed me to reconcile trade-offs across caching, validation, and schema design, while the documentation reminded me that code is only as valuable as its ability to be trusted and understood. I now feel prepared to enter a professional team, advocate for quality, and keep learning on day one.</p>
