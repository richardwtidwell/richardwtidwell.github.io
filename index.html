      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>This capstone challenged me to merge classroom theory with production work. Expand the section below for a holistic look at my journey, the skills evidenced by the artifacts that follow, and the direction I am pursuing professionally.</p>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Across three years at SNHU I moved from an enthusiastic hobbyist to a disciplined engineer who can design, ship, and defend production-ready web software. Travlr Getaways—a full-stack artifact enhanced throughout CS 499—captures that growth through deliberate architecture, measurable algorithmic gains, and a hardened database workflow.</p>

          <h3>Personal &amp; Professional Journey</h3>
          <p>I enrolled at SNHU as part of a deliberate reset when my first son was born. I left food service for technical support at an ISP, transitioned into network operations, and finally into an IT help desk role where a supportive manager encouraged me to automate internal workflows. Side projects such as a company-wide data consolidation pipeline and classical machine learning models (still running in production) gave me the chance to apply coursework the very next day at work. That momentum led to promotions into AI automation and, today, a lead engineer role on a B2B SaaS platform that still contains components I built while in this program.</p>

          <h3>Program Outcome Highlights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaboration &amp; Communication:</strong> Produced a narrated code-review walkthrough with actionable feedback, maintained contributor-facing docs, and curated this portfolio for multiple audiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Communication:</strong> Authored milestone narratives, OpenAPI references, and inline evidence blocks that explain design trade-offs and give reviewers reproducible steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures:</strong> Implemented an O(1) LRU cache and prefix trie, benchmarked them, and added node:test coverage to validate behaviour and complexity claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Engineering &amp; Value Delivery:</strong> Migrated the Express API to TypeScript with layered services, structured logging, validation, and CI-friendly scripts that keep the project reproducible.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Hardened write endpoints with JWT protection, deterministic capacity checks, and strict validation while documenting expected 401/409 responses.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Artifact Highlights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Layered, strongly typed Express/Angular stack with modern tooling.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures:</strong> In-memory caching and trie search pipeline with unit tests and benchmarks.</li>
            <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Embedded reservation schema, atomic booking logic, and occupancy analytics exposed via REST.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Career Goals &amp; Next Steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Grow as a backend/data engineer with a focus on scalable, reliable services.</li>
            <li>Contribute to open source projects to sharpen collaboration and code review skills.</li>
            <li>Pursue Kubernetes certification</li>
            <li>Have fun doing it</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>CS 499 forced me to think like both architect and storyteller. Balancing caching, validation, and schema design while communicating the trade-offs reminded me that code delivers value only when others can trust and extend it. I am ready to join a professional team, advocate for quality, and keep learning on day one.</p>

            <p><em>CS 499 Module Two Journal – Code Review Plan</em></p>
            <p>Code review is a structured peer examination of a change set that checks design, correctness, readability, security, and maintainability before integration. It spreads knowledge across the team, finds defects earlier than testing alone, and enforces shared engineering standards, lowering rework and operational risk (Google, n.d.; SmartBear, n.d.; OWASP Foundation, n.d.; Winters, Manshreck, &amp; Wright, 2020).</p>
            <p>My recorded review keeps PRs small, follows a visible checklist, and addresses three lenses:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Software engineering &amp; design:</strong> Validate separation of concerns, typing, validation, error handling, logging, tests, and documentation.</li>
              <li><strong>Algorithms &amp; data structures:</strong> Reconfirm problem statements, Big-O claims, boundary conditions, and benchmark evidence.</li>
              <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Inspect schemas, indexes, validation rules, and least-privilege access while logging follow-up actions.</li>

        <h3>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>
        <p>Search acceleration via an LRU cache, prefix trie, server-side pagination, and indexed MongoDB queries to keep latency predictable.</p>
        <details class="accordion">
          <summary>Read Milestone Three narrative</summary>
          <div class="accordion__body">
            <p>The enhanced artifact is the Travlr search and listing subsystem. It exposes Mongo-backed endpoints consumed by the admin UI. For this milestone I focused on measurable latency improvements at the API layer, introducing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A capacity-bound LRU cache with TTL and instrumentation to reuse identical queries.</li>
              <li>A case-insensitive prefix trie powering typeahead for trip codes and names.</li>
              <li>Server-side pagination and compound sorting so work scales with page size rather than collection size.</li>
              <li>Repository/service abstractions with stable cache keys, periodic trie refresh, input validation, consistent error envelopes, and rate limiting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tests cover the LRU and trie using <code>node:test</code>, while benchmark scripts capture trie build times and cache throughput. The work addresses Outcome 3 by selecting structures with known complexity, Outcome 4 through layered design plus tests/benchmarks, and Outcome 5 via validation, bounded caches, and abuse-resistant limits.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned to favour designs with predictable cost and to pair indexing with in-memory assistance only when the working set can stay hot. Stable ordering, staleness, and worst-case query sweeps were mitigated with lexical traversal limits, periodic refresh, strict validation, and rate limiting.</p>

          <summary>Read Milestone Four narrative</summary>
          <div class="accordion__body">
            <p>The database enhancement focuses on extending the Travlr API to support reservations end to end. Key additions include embedded reservation documents (customer name/email, party size, notes, timestamps), capacity-aware booking logic, and JWT-protected reporting endpoints.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Enhancements:</strong> Reservation services (`reservationService.bookTrip` / `getOccupancyReport`), Zod validation, structured errors, and synced Angular service models.</li>
              <li><strong>Evidence &amp; testing:</strong> Curl sessions capture successful bookings and occupancy summaries, while `src/test/bookingValidation.test.ts` exercises the new validator.</li>
              <li><strong>Outcomes covered:</strong> Outcome 3 (aggregation pipelines and deterministic capacity checks), Outcome 4 (layered design, tests, docs), Outcome 5 (JWT protection, strict validation, idempotent capacity checks).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Aligning schema design with real-world invariants (remaining seats, audit history) while keeping controllers thin reinforced the need for clear seams between services and data. Future work could include cancellation flows, reporting UI, and regression tests against dockerised MongoDB.</p>
